# This is a code sample from my previous work as a Clinical Data Analyst.
# It supports a population-based cohort study on the risk of CCVD in Korean patients
# with psoriasis, based on systemic antipsoriatic therapy exposure. 
# The original script included over 1,000 lines of code. Here, Iâ€™ve reorganized it 
# to focus key parts of the analysis, including:

# - Data cleaning and treatment group assignment
# - Table 1: Baseline demographics 
# - Table 2: Impact of systemic therapy duration on CCVD risk
# - Table 3: Subgroup analysis of CCVD risk by treatment type
# - Figure 2: GAM model showing adjusted odds ratios by percent treatment period (PTP)
#
# This work was published in a high-impact dermatology journal.
# For holistic overview, please refer to the paper "Publication2_AntipsoriaticTherapy_CCVD.pdf"
# uploaded in my `Clinical Research Portfolio` GitHub repository.
