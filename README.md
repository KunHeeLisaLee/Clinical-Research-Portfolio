# Clinical-Research-Portfolio
This repository documents my previous work as a Clinical Data Analyst, including co-authored research publications and corresponding code samples.
As the lead statistician on these projects, I contributed to all phases of study design, from defining study groups and selecting analytical methods to producing publication-ready tables and figures.
